## Very first steps

1. Edit YAML front matter 
2. Write using R Markdown 
3. Use an empty line followed by three dashes to separate slides! 
4. Insert R code using ```

--- .class #id 

## Actual presentation

Er... already said! No?,ok I´ll show you an interactive bit
```{r echo = F, results = 'asis'}
require(rCharts)
haireye = as.data.frame(HairEyeColor)
n1 <- nPlot(Freq ~ Hair, group = 'Eye', type = 'multiBarChart',
  data = subset(haireye, Sex == 'Male')
)
n1$print('chart1')
```

--- .class #id

## No, seriously

This is all
